# Window Manager

A Python utility for managing browser window positions and sizes. This tool allows you to capture, restore, and automatically rearrange window layouts based on window titles.

## Features

- **Capture Layout**: Save the current position and size of all windows matching a specific title pattern.
- **Restore Layout**: Restore windows to their saved positions and sizes.
- **Auto Rearrange**: Automatically redistribute windows to saved slots when the number of open windows changes.
- **Active Monitoring**: Continuously monitor window states and automatically correct positions if they drift or resize (e.g., due to game scaling).
- **Tolerance Control**: Adjustable sensitivity for position/size change detection.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI provides a user-friendly way to manage window layouts.

```bash
python window_manager_gui.py
```

**Key Functions:**
- **Capture**: Save the current layout of the specified windows.
- **Restore**: Apply the saved layout to current windows.
- **Rearrange**: Re-sort windows into the saved slots.
- **Monitor**: Start background monitoring to maintain the layout automatically.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

You can also use the tool via the command line for scripting or automation.

**Capture Layout:**
```bash
python window_manager.py capture "Window Title Pattern"
```

**Restore Layout:**

python window_manager.py list
```

## Configuration

Window positions are stored in `window_positions.json`. This file is automatically generated and updated by the tool.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows OS (due to `pygetwindow` dependency)
